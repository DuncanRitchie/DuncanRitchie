# Hi. I’m Duncan Ritchie.
I am a junior software developer, knowledgeable of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Excel, Sql, Java, and C#.

I studied for twenty-four weeks at the web development bootcamp Code Nation, and I work for the R&D company Information Catalyst. This enabled me to fulfil an apprenticeship.

Code I wrote for my apprenticeship is on [my second GitHub account](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2).

The GitHub repos I’ve contributed most to are for [my personal website](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/DuncanRitchie.github.io) and my [Latin vocabulary website](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut) (I have a master’s in Latin). I have a few other repos.

See my website for [more about my coding œuvre](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/code.html).

🗺️ I live in Chester, UK.

🗨️ My pronouns are he/him.

🐦 My logo is a fulmar, because I saw a lot of the North Atlantic seabirds while at uni on the Scottish coast.
